# Bone Cancer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project is focused on segmenting bone cancer regions in medical images using advanced machine learning and image processing techniques. The goal is to assist in precise treatment planning and monitoring by identifying affected areas accurately.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing:** Noise reduction and normalization techniques for better segmentation.
- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes state-of-the-art segmentation models like U-Net.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes dice coefficient and IoU for performance analysis.
- **Visualization:** Displays segmented regions overlayed on original images.
